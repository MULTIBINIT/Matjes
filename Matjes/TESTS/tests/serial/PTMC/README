This is a simple test run of a simple PTMC simulation with the Ising Model.

This was simulated in serial.
40 temperature steps, 1 CPU, 50 replicas/processor (nRepProc not needed for the serial version)

Input:
- inp 	see better commented inp file in the 01_mpirun
	(Ising model,
	number of swapping steps (n_relaxation, n_sizerelax (I put them always the same, because if they were wrong chosen: seg fault), 
	coeffs, 
	autocorrelation steps 
	...)
- lattice.in (size, square lattice)
- spiral.start (staring from a FM)

Output:
- The Spinstructures are written in the Spinse_files in the folder PICS
- EM.dat gives different thermodynamical quantities
- T-range gives information about the swapping of the replicas depending on temperature
- temperature.out gives the temperatures at the end in the case of an optimization of the temperature set
- param.dat summerizes the inputs
